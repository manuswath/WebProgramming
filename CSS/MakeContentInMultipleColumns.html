				The Leuchtenberg Gallery was the collection of artworks of the Dukes of Leuchtenberg, on public display in Munich. The collection was widely known in 19th-century Europe, due to being open to the public and having a high-quality illustrated catalogue in different languages, and was considered one of the most important private collections of the time. The collection was a heritage from Napoleonic times through Joséphine de Beauharnais, but with new additions by the subsequent Dukes, especially Eugène de Beauharnais. By 1841, the collection was largely complete. The Gallery was located in the Palais Leuchtenberg. After the death of Duke Maximilian in 1852, the Gallery was closed. The majority of the collection remained together until the Russian Revolution in 1917, when it was dispersed and a number of paintings sold in Sweden. Many works ended up in museums all over the world, such as Parmigianino's Circumcision of Jesus (pictured), which is now housed at the Detroit Institute of Arts. The remaining works are either lost or in private collections.
